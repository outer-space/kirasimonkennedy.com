          <p>I help creative people do impactful & interesting things as the co-founder & director of China Residencies, a co-founder of Rivet, and an independent film producer.<br/>
          I like writting guides, mentoring collectives, and curating meme tactics.<br/>
          These days I mostly go between New York, and the 50+ places we work with in mainland China & Hong Kong. <br/><p/>
